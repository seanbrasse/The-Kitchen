        <p>
        	I am Tijmen Van Der Beek and I am a junior in computer engineering at University at Buffalo. I have always had an interest in computers but I didn't view this as a career option until after I took a programing course in high school. I have enjoyed being a computer engineering student so far and I can't wait to graduate.
