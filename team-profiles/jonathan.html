        <p>
            Jonathan is a sophomore UB computer science student and software developer for the
            <a href="https://eternagame.org">Eternagame</a> research project/citizen science game, in addition
            to being a member of the Deliberate Development CSE370 team. Outside of writing software, he is a creative,
            and you might see him playing french horn with the UBSO or just having fun playing paino or composing
            music, or maybe dabbling in 3D art, writing, or something having to do with LEGO. He tends to come up with
            big ideas - sometimes with a good vision and sometimes overkill. Also enjoys cute/cozy/fluffy things.
